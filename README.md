# Python-Exercises

When I started my journey in I.T, Beecrowd (old Uri Online Judge) was the first site that allowed me to practice the programming content I was learning at vast levels and difficulties. Exercises are separated by numbers according to their difficulty. É simples procurar as perguntas, é só colocar no google o número da pergunta mais uri ou beecrowd, tipo (beecrowd 1090 python) or access the website https://www.beecrowd.com.br/judge/pt.
