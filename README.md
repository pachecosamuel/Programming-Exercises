# Python-Exercises

When I started my journey in I.T, Beecrowd (old Uri Online Judge) was the first site that allowed me to practice the programming content I was learning at vast levels and difficulties. Exercises are separated by numbers according to their difficulty. It's simple to look for the questions, it's only put on google the number of the question plus uri or beecrowd, like (beecrowd 1090 python) https://www.beecrowd.com.br/judge/pt.
